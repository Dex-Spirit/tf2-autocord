# tf2-autocord
A Discord bot that effectively negates the need for Steam Chat. Put any issues in #help or if you find any errors in my code put them in #lol-wtf-happened

To get started:

1. Download [Python version 3.6.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/).

2. [Create your self a discord bot](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).

        - Click New Application.

        - Type your bot's name.

        - Click on the sidebar where it says bot.

        - Click Add Bot.

        - Then copy your token, store this for later.

        - Create a new discord server.

        - Invite your bot using OAuth2, go-to scopes and click bot and copy and paste the URL into your search bar.
    
    
3. Clone the repo to somewhere on your HDD or a VPS.

4. [Join the discord server](https://discord.gg/S3eVmxD) to get important info and updates.

5. Run the setup file, you should see some CMD prompts open and close leaving them is fine.

6. Fill in all your prefernces, if you can't figure out how to get them, check on the internet and then if you still can't DM me or use the #help channel on the discord server. Then enter your details of your personal account and your discord bot's token, in IDLE.

8. Run Main.py using F5 if you are using IDLE.

9. In your discord sever check your bot is online and type your `command_prefix` + 'info' to check everything is working, everything is DM safe if you would rather DM commands.

If you have any issues DM me :)
